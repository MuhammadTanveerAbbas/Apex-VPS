### 🧠 AI Chatbot Flow

The **Apex AI chatbot**, powered by **Google’s Genkit**, acts as an intelligent sales and support assistant.

**Workflow:**

1. User sends a message via the `WhatsAppWidget`.
2. Request triggers the `chatWithBot` server function in `src/ai/flows/chatFlow.ts`.
3. The Genkit flow sends the prompt to the **Google Gemini** model.
4. The model replies as “Apex,” the hosting assistant.
5. Response is returned and displayed to the user.

```
[User] → [WhatsAppWidget.tsx] → [chatFlow.ts (Server Action)] → [Genkit AI Flow] → [Google AI]
  ↑                                                                                  |
  └─────────────────────────────── [Response Returned] ───────────────────────────────┘
